            <h1>​A PROBLEM ON THE RISE</h1>

            <p>Of the many crimes that affect humanity today, acid attacks are one of the worst. Their cruelty is just one aspect; the emotional and physical effects can sometimes be far more troubling. Quite often, victims feel that their only option is to end their own lives. <br> <br> 
            The frequency of acid attacks is particularly high in the Indian context, demanding immediate and decisive action.</p>

        <h2>SO WHAT'S THE </h2>
        <h1>ROOT CAUSE?</h1>

        <p class="root-cause-para">
            According to the Acid Survivors Foundation India, the motives behind acid attacks range from something as simple as a girl rejecting a boy’s gestures of affection, to more deep-seated cultural issues such as dowry. While vengeance is a key reason, there are several other causes, as shown below.

            <p>Acid attacks have lifelong repercussions that are very difficult to ignore. That’s why humanitarians across the country feel compelled to act, and this has led to the birth of numerous institutions and programmes that help these women take control of their lives again.

            In the current scenario, the focus is on helping women after an attack. However, the issue needs a more holistic approach: one that directs its efforts at changing mindsets, demanding more stringent laws, and rehabilitating survivors effectively.
